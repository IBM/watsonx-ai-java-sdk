/**
 * Represents the reasoning configuration used by the LLM.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Thinking} instance defines how the LLM should handle reasoning output — specifying both how reasoning and response segments are extracted
 * and the level of reasoning effort to apply during generation.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note on {@link #extractionTags}:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If {@code extractionTags} is provided, it is used to automatically extract the reasoning and response segments from the LLM's output. This is
 * necessary for models that return both reasoning and response within a single text string. (e.g. the <b>ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct</b>)</li>
 * <li>If {@code extractionTags} is {@code null}, the LLM is assumed to provide reasoning and response as separate fields. (e.g. the
 * <b>openai/gpt-oss-120b</b>)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage examples:</b>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * // Using reasoning with a model like openai/gpt-oss-120b
 * Thinking.of(ThinkingEffort.HIGH);
 *
 * // Using reasoning with a model like ibm/granite-3-3-8b-instruct
 * Thinking.of(ExtractionTags.of("think", "response"));
